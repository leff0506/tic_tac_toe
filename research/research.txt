The task is divided into two stage.
<ul>
  <li>Gesture detection.</li>
  <li>Game engine.</li>
</ul>
Second step is casual so only first stage deserves our attention.
After several days of googling I found two solutions.
<ul>
  <li>Algorithm based on skin selection by hsv range of skin color. After selection we can find contours. Based on the contours, you can say how many fingers a person shows.</li>
  <li>This algorithm differs from the previous one in that the hand selection is not based on color but on the background selection.</li>
</ul>
First algorithm doesn`t work well because if in the background is color that looks like skin it will be also selected. <br/>
Second algorithm doesn`t work well because if the background changes it will destroy the full algorithm.<br/>
This led me to think about using neural networks.<br/>
First my try was to make my own CNN using dataset from <a href ="https://www.kaggle.com/koryakinp/fingers">kaggle</a>.
